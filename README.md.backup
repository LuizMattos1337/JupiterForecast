# JupiterWeather

A server side application using Spring to respond to HTTP requests and provide local weather data using the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

## Description

This is a simple project I created to test the skills I had been learning in my full-stack developer program. I wanted to create a server side application that responded to HTTP requests and provided local weather data that could be deployed to a platform such as Heroku for use in in conjunction with a future client side weather application.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* JRE/JRE version 18.0.2 or higher
* You will need an OpenWeatherMap API key which can be acquired for free on [their website](https://openweathermap.org/appid).

### Installing

* Clone the repo to your local machine
* Add your api to as the value for the key "owm.apiKey" in src/main/resources/application.properties as below. Please note that there should be no quotes (e.g. " or ') of any kind around the value.
```
owm.apiKey=yourApiKeyGoesHere
```

### Executing program

* Compile and run the application
* Once the server is running locally, open your browser to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/weather/text?zipCode=10108` and you will see the current weather for that zip code in plain text format.
```
Location: New York(US), Weather: overcast clouds, 65.37 Â°F, 1023.0 hPa, Clouds: 100%
```
* If you would prefer to receive the full (VERY detailed) weather information, instead use http://localhost:8080/api/v1/weather?zipCode=10108

### Want to try it now?
This application is running and deployed and can be found [here](http://jupiterforecast.luizmattos.tech/api/v1/weather?zipCode=10108) until Heroku discontinues their free tier on November 28, 2022. At that point, I'll have to weigh my options and possibly migrate to another hosting solution.

## Project Status
This project is mostly dormant as of this writing on September 28, 2022. I'm currently wrapping up my full stack development boot camp and will soon begin looking for a career as a developer. Once my coursework and job search are complete I do hope to go back and update this project using my new skills and knowledge.

## Room for improvement
Todo:
- Querying weather by location name
- Querying weather by latitude/longitude
- Add a front-end UI via a webapp to display the data in a user friendly and visually appealing way
